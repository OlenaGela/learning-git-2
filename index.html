          <p>Is it getting better?
          <br>Or do you feel the same?
          <br>Will it make it easier on you now?
          <br>You got someone to blame</p>
          <p>You say, one love, one life
          <br>When it's one need in the night
          <br>One love, we get to share it
          <br>Leaves you baby if you don't care for it</p>
          <p>Did I disappoint you?
          <br>Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
          <br>You act like you never had love
          <br>And you want me to go without</p>
          <p>Well it's too late tonight
          <br>To drag the past out into the light
          <br>We're one but we're not the same
          <br>We get to carry each other, carry each other
          <br>One!</p>
          <p>Have you come here for forgiveness?
          <br>Have you come to raise the dead?
          <br>Have you come here to play Jesus?
          <br>To the lepers in your head</p>
          <p>Did I ask too much? More than a lot
          <br>You gave me nothin' now it's all I got
          <br>We're one but we're not the same
          <br>Well we hurt each other then we do it again</p>
          <p>You say love is a temple, love a higher law
          <br>Love is a temple, love the higher law
          <br>You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
          <br>And I can't be holdin' on to what you got
          <br>When all you got is hurt</p>
          <p>One love, one blood
          <br>One life, you got to do what you should
          <br>One life, with each other
          <br>Sisters, brothers</p>
          <p>One life but we're not the same
          <br>We get to carry each other, carry each other
          <br><br>One
          <br><br><br>One</p>
